## Introduction

This course will guide you through a few fundamental CSS concepts.

<br />

Keep in mind that some principles laid out here are broad and may not be accurate or reliable for every situation.

<br />

> ðŸ’¡ This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

This tutorial will cover the following items in order:

- [Box Model](#box-model)
- [HTML Defaults](#html-defaults)
- [Flexible Box Layout](#flexible-box-layout)
- [Grid Box Layout](#grid-box-layout)
- [Responsive Design](#responsive-design)
- [Selectors](#selectors)
- [Units](#units)
- [Variables](#variables)

## Box Model

![css-box-model.svg](https://ljtech.ca/content/css-box-model.svg)

The box model is a representation of a documents element through a set of boxes with the following properties:

- Margin: Wraps any border, padding, and content as white space. Sized using `margin`.
- Border: Wraps any padding and content. Sized and styled using `border`.
- Padding: Wraps any contents as white space. Sized using `padding`.
- Content: Sized using `width` and `height`.

Every element on the browser has a box model. You can inspect them using browser developer tools. Understanding the box model layers will help you identify element boundaries.

## HTML Defaults

Every HTML element has default browser styles. These styles are called HTML defaults.

<br />

For example, a div element by default has `display: block` and a `ul` element by default has `list-style-type: disc`.

<br />

<br />

You can use default styles to create a layout with minimal styling. In most cases, these default styles are overridden or unset as they are not necessary or wanted.

<br />

Never use an HTML element without first reading its documentation. Simply put, every HTML element has a place and a purpose.

## Flexible Box Layout

Also known as flexbox, it is the primary method used to align, justify, and space elements. Flexbox creates one-dimensional layouts on a column(vertical axis, `block`) or row(horizontal axis, `inline`).

<br />

To create a flexbox, set the wrapping HTML elements `display` property to `flex`. Adding `flex` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become flex items.

## Grid Box Layout

Commonly referred to as gridbox. It is capable of creating a two-dimensional layout using both columns and rows.

<br />

To create a gridbox, set the wrapping HTML elements `display` property to `grid`. Adding `grid` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become grid items.

## Responsive Design

Responsive Design is an approach to web design where the goal is to create a layout that renders beautifully on any device or screen size.

<br />

Designers can use media queries (breakpoints) to override styles for targeted screen sizes, although the aim is to achieve a mobile-friendly layout without overriding too much.

<br />

A great method is to design for mobile devices first. This way, styles can be added as the screen sizes increase.

<br />

Here is a list of popular breakpoints:

- Mobile S: 320px
- Mobile M: 375px
- Mobile L: 425px
- Tablet: 768px
- Laptop: 1024px
- Laptop L: 1440px

## Selectors

A CSS selector defines the targeted elements and allows for CSS rules to be applied. There are five basic CSS selectors:

- Universal: Targets all elements, eg: `*`.
- Class: Targets all with the given class, eg: `.class`.
- ID: Targets all with the given ID, eg: `#id`
- Type: Targets all with the given type, eg `h1`
- Attribute: Targets all with the given attribute, eg `[type="submit"]`

Sometimes CSS rules share the same properties. You can group selectors under one CSS rule using commas to share properties among multiple selectors.

<br />

You can also combine selectors using a variety of syntax to target anything from descendants to siblings.

<br />

I recommended using the class selector over the ID selector for styling.

## Units

CSS properties will only accept certain value types. For example, the CSS property color expects a color type value, which could be `red`, `#ff0000`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, etc.

<br />

There are four numeric value types:

- Integer: `1024` or `-55`
- Number: `0.255`, `128`, or `-1.2`
- Percentage: `50%`
- Dimension: covers four sub-types
  - Length: `10px`
  - Angle: `45deg`
  - Time: `5s`
  - Resolution: `300dpi`

Most CSS properties accept length values.

<br />

There are seven absolute and eight relative length units.

<br />

It is unusual to use them all, so included below is a list of the most common ones:

- `px`: Pixels, absolute length unit.
- `em`: Relative to the parent size.
- `rem`: Relative to the root element size.
- `vw`: View-width, relative to the current device.
- `vh`: View-height, relative to the current device.

<br />

My recommendations on what to use:

- use `px` for `font-sizing`, `border-width`, `@media` query breaks and similar properties
- use `rem` for `font-sizing`, `padding`, `margin`, and pretty much anything
- use `vh` for the CSS `height` property

<br />

## Variables

CSS variables allow us to define CSS properties as arbitrary values for reuse across a CSS document. It is common to use CSS variables for color values or other repeated values.
