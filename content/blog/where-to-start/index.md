Have you ever wanted to get into computer programming but don't know where to start or search? Well in this article I wanna teach you basic computer programming terms, uses, and skills that go along with computer programming.

## Terms
A term is a word or phrase used to describe a thing or to express a concept, especially in a particular kind of language or branch of study. We use computer science or CS terms.

### Variables
In computer programming, a variable is a storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data within a computer program.

#### Arrays
An array is a collection of elements that are stored together in a contiguous memory location and can be accessed using an index or a key. Arrays are used to store and manipulate a large number of data items of the same type efficiently.1 

#### Strings
In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text and can be manipulated using various operations such as concatenation, substring, and search.

#### Number
A number variable is used to store numeric data such as integers, floating-point numbers, and decimals. Number variables are used to perform arithmetic and mathematical operations in a computer program.

### Loops
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops: for loops, which execute a fixed number of times, and while loops, which execute until a certain condition is no longer true.

#### For
When programming you may encounter, a for loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code for a fixed number of times. The loop consists of three parts: the initialization, the condition, and the increment/decrement, which are used to control the loop's execution.

#### While
a while loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop consists of the condition and the code block, and it continues to execute until the condition is no longer true.

### Statements
Statements are instructions that are executed in a specific sequence to perform a certain task or action in a program.

#### If
It it a condition checker, usually built in to every luanguage. You give it a condition to check and it gives and it does something when the condition is met.

#### While
While loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The loop consists of the condition and the code block, and it continues to execute until the condition is no longer true.

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task or action. Functions can take input parameters and return output values, and they are used to modularize code and make it more organized and easier to maintain.

#### Built-in (Objects)
Built in functions are usually things that do something small like JavaScripts toString function that takes a numaricale value and turns it into a string.
