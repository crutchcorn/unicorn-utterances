Have you ever wanted to get into computer programming but don't know where to start or search? Well in this article I wanna teach you basic computer programming terms, uses, and skills that go along with computer programming.

## Terms
A term is a word or phrase used to describe a thing or to express a concept, especially in a particular kind of language or branch of study. We use computer science or CS terms.

### Variables
In computer programming, a variable is a storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data within a computer program.

#### Arrays
An array is a collection of elements that are stored together in a contiguous memory location and can be accessed using an index or a key. Arrays are used to store and manipulate a large number of data items of the same type efficiently.1 

#### Strings
In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters that is used to represent text and can be manipulated using various operations such as concatenation, substring, and search.

#### Number
A number variable is used to store numeric data such as integers, floating-point numbers, and decimals. Number variables are used to perform arithmetic and mathematical operations in a computer program.

### Loops
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops: for loops, which execute a fixed number of times, and while loops, which execute until a certain condition is no longer true.

#### For
When programming you may encounter, a for loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code for a fixed number of times. The loop consists of three parts: the initialization, the condition, and the increment/decrement, which are used to control the loop's execution.

#### While
a while loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop consists of the condition and the code block, and it continues to execute until the condition is no longer true.

### Statements
Statements are instructions that are executed in a specific sequence to perform a certain task or action in a program.

#### If
It it a condition checker, usually built into every language. You give it a condition to check and it gives and it does something when the condition is met.

#### While
While loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The loop consists of the condition and the code block, and it continues to execute until the condition is no longer true.

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task or action. Functions can take input parameters and return output values, and they are used to modularize code and make it more organized and easier to maintain.

#### Built-in (Objects)
Built-in functions are usually things that do something small like JavaScript's toString function that takes a numerical value and turns it into a string.

## First language
Choosing your first programming language can be hard, but we can make it easier to pick one.
Some good starting languages would be Python, JavaScript, or C.  Python is good for learning the basics of computer programming in a very easy way. It allows for user input and out all in a simple interface while keeping simplicity. JavaScript is another good one to learn as it is usually used in modern-day web development and software. Its interface runs through HTML which you would have to learn too, but it's a good second or starting language. C is the hardest on this list in my opinion, but if you learn C and expand on your skills with C or even C++ you will learn lot's about developing software and complex languages. 

Some ways to start learning these languages on your own could be just to look some things up on YouTube and build off of the little things you learn, eventually, you will get there I'm self-taught about three years into this journey, and I'm doing better than ever, but to get there you need time and motivation, keep going and build your skills.


## Comfort Zones
Let's say you have learned more than what I've said in this article and you want to expand on whatever, I recommend getting into a community and sharing your work, posting it to GitHub learning the terminal and other languages around what you work with, and expand.
