Today's a big day. After 5 years of this platform being called "Unicorn Utterances", **we're rebranding to "Playful Programming"**.

> What? Why? What does this mean?

To talk about that, let's explore the history of Unciorn Utterances as a whole.

# The Timeline

- October 2014: [Corbin Crutchley](/unicorns/crutchcorn) (cofounder of the platform; author of this post) turns 16. Not only are they a year older; they started working at an adult high school as their only tech person. This role required them to learn Python and Bash; starting their career early on.

  Partly due to the new job, partly due to an overaching interest in tech; Corbin joined the [social media platform Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B) (remember that?) and started talking with other people on the platform.

  The list of people they met would eventially be a whos-who of Unicorn Utterances alumni:

  - [James Fenn](/unicorns/fennifith) (cofounder)
  - [Evelyn Hathaway](/unicorns/evelynhathaway) (cofounder)
  - [Vukašin Anđelković](https://unicorn-utterances.com/unicorns/zavukodlak) (logo designer)
  - [Tom Wellington](/unicorns/tommyemo) (initial design lead)
  - [Eduardo Pratti](/unicorns/edpratti) (future/present design lead)
  - [Alex Dueppen](/unicorns/adueppen) (developer, moderator)
  - [Kevin Aguilar](/unicorns/kevttob) (designer)

- May 2018: Corbin starts working 
- May 19th, 2019: The `unicorn-utterances.com` domain was registered.
